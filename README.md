- 👋 Hi, I’m @The-Neuro-Plasticity-Hypothesis
- 👀 I’m interested in using programming languages to increase my understanding on how the world works. And it`s fum, so using it as a job would mean I`d never work again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python and R. Next would be C#, Javascript and PHP.
- 💞️ I’m not sure what projects I would like to collaborate with on here. I`m currently focusing on just learning, and developing stuff with people outside of github.
- 📫 How to reach me: e.d.n.utdanning@gmail.com
